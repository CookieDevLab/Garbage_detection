# Garbage Detection AI

## Project Description
An AI-powered web tool that classifies images as 'Clean' or 'Dirty' using a trained TensorFlow/Keras model. Built with Flask, HTML, and CSS, this application aims to promote cleaner environments by providing a visual analysis of image cleanliness.

## Features
* **AI-Powered Classification:** Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to predict whether an image depicts a clean or dirty environment.
* **User-Friendly Web Interface:** Simple and intuitive design for easy image uploads and result viewing.
* **Image Upload & Prediction:** Allows users to upload JPG, JPEG, and PNG images and displays immediate prediction results with confidence scores.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for seamless experience across various devices.
* **Team & About Sections:** Provides information about the project and the development team.

## Technologies Used
* **Python 3.x**
* **Flask:** Web framework for the backend.
* **TensorFlow / Keras:** For the machine learning model.
* **HTML, CSS:** For the frontend web pages and styling.
* **Numpy:** For numerical operations.
* **Werkzeug:** For secure filename handling.

## Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get the Garbage Detection AI application running on your local machine:

### 1. Prerequisites
* **Git:** Make sure Git is installed on your system. ([Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads))
* **Python 3.x:** Ensure Python 3 is installed. ([Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/))

### 2. Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CookieDevLab/Garbage_detection
cd your-repo-name # Replace with your actual repository folder name
```

### 3. Set Up a Virtual Environment
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

###4. Activate the Virtual Environment
On Windows:
```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
On macOS / Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 5. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install numpy tensorflow matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn Pillow
```

### 6. Train the Model
The model.keras file is not directly included in the repository. You need to train the model yourself using the provided dataset and training script.
Ensure your dataset is organized as expected by your training script.
Run your training script

```bash
python garbagedetection.py
```

# Important: Your training script must save the trained model as model.keras directly in the root directory of this project (the same directory as app.py).

### 7. Run the Application
Once the model.keras file has been generated by your training script, you can run the Flask application:
```bash 
python app.py
```
The application will start on http://127.0.0.1:5000/. Open your web browser and navigate to:

http://127.0.0.1:5000/ for the home page.
http://127.0.0.1:5000/tool to upload images and get predictions.
